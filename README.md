# Speedy Splash

A Fabric mod that disables the Mojang splash screen's fade-out animation and title screen's fade-in animation. This makes the main menu appear faster and makes switching resource packs faster.

For even faster startup time, you are recommended to use this mod along with [LazyDFU](https://github.com/astei/lazydfu).
